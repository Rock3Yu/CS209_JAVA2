The Java compiler and the JVM work together to create the illusion that you can access a local variable from a lambda. I write &quot;illusion&quot; because the rules of Java allow it to copy the value a local variable holds somewhere else (presumable into the object created for the lambda) so that the lambda can access that copy"},{"owner":{"account_id":28457297,"reputation":21,"user_id":21774510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/722c29cfc576f122dabf1e013b126ef0?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"algernon.zakary-donebyngle-com","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21774510/algernon-zakary-donebyngle-com"},"reply_to_user":{"account_id":7423601,"reputation":17073,"user_id":5646962,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/950788cd150c2e596944181dfd8421af?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Thomas Kl&#228;ger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5646962/thomas-kl%c3%a4ger"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1682857025,"post_id":76137770,"comment_id":134277951,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"@ThomasKl&#228;ger regarding <i><b>the only way</b></i> I disagree: lambdas could be implemented differently.

An operation equivalent to the first would have to use <code>(sb, c) -&gt; sb.append((char)c)</code> instead of <code>StringBuilder::appendCodePoint</code>. But a better solution, in the sense of handling characters outside the BMP correctly, would be using <code>codePoints()</code> instead of <code>chars()</code> together with <code>StringBuilder::appendCodePoint</code>. But once you’ve learned that even codepoints are not enough to handle all logical characters correctly (read about <i>grapheme clusters</i>), you might narrow your task and just use variant 1…"},{"owner":{"account_id":7612423,"reputation":80631,"user_id":5772882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/58mlb.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Ole V.V.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5772882/ole-v-v"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1683706359,"post_id":76215275,"comment_id":134406033,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"If you want more detail and/or an explanation what went wrong in your code, you will need to include a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example\">minimal reproducible example</a> in your question."},{"owner":{"account_id":1910,"reputation":91019,"user_id":2635,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/503dc458e66746c5ac681e7057d209dd?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mmcdole","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2635/mmcdole"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1232488309,"post_id":463155,"comment_id":281806,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"Duplicate of: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/392932/how-do-i-use-the-ternary-operator\" title=\"how do i use the ternary operator\">stackoverflow.com/questions/392932/&hellip;</a>."},{"owner":{"account_id":3552435,"reputation":341,"user_id":2966998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiLvm.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Asela Senanayake","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2966998/asela-senanayake"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1578634583,"post_id":57692668,"comment_id":105510102,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"Does anyone have a solution for this?

While the obtained <code>OffsetDateTime</code> will not know which time zone it came from, the <code>now</code> method will respect the time zone and its anomalies and give you the time at the correct offset for the time of year according to standard time and summer time and other anomalies. For example in my time zone you may get 2023-05-04T12:28+02:00 now and 2023-12-12T23:15+01:00 next winter."},{"owner":{"account_id":1705601,"reputation":549,"user_id":1564698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5e3e49a38d10aa91a264714e7567f9?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Shourya Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1564698/shourya-sharma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1683202842,"post_id":76171033,"comment_id":134332342,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"what do you mean by: &quot;my team was using the older version of jdk 1.8&quot;?"},{"owner":{"account_id":10436649,"reputation":5666,"user_id":7694740,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLLG0.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Juan Carlos Mendoza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7694740/juan-carlos-mendoza"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1509374837,"post_id":47018120,"comment_id":80982641,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"And what have you tried so far?"},{"owner":{"account_id":3629749,"reputation":23934,"user_id":3026283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SyT5b.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"H&#233;ctor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3026283/h%c3%a9ctor"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1509374995,"post_id":47018120,"comment_id":80982768,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"1) Take 4 random indices. 2) Create an array with size 4. 3) Copy the 4 numbers to second array 4) Profit"},{"owner":{"account_id":3116234,"reputation":9216,"user_id":2636929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85fa83a02c04af43fcd224821ca9b750?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stultuske","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2636929/stultuske"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1509374858,"post_id":47018120,"comment_id":80982657,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"what are &#39;generators&#39;?"},{"owner":{"account_id":2264130,"reputation":38051,"user_id":1993366,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGJXl.png?s=256&g=1","display_name":"vikingsteve","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1993366/vikingsteve"},"reply_to_user":{"account_id":7226774,"reputation":19475,"user_id":5515060,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d799a3f9fa2cfe1bcebe2c73cd5aa77d?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Lino","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5515060/lino"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1509395607,"post_id":47018120,"comment_id":80994472,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"@Lino not in this universe at least... ;)"},{"owner":{"account_id":4181375,"reputation":3942,"user_id":3426309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v58O6.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Andrey B.
